A newly initiated necromancer starts with one Level One ritual for free; every other ritual must be found and learned in play. They work much like their Thaumaturgical cousins, but the two arts are wholly incompatible.</p><p><b>System:</b> Casting time varies by ritual; see each entry. Roll Intelligence + Occult against difficulty 3 + the ritual's level (capped at 9). Success carries the ritual, failure wastes the effort, and a botch means something has answered that should not have.</p>`,

    description: `<p>Where paths give a thaumaturge flexible power, rituals are the opposite: painstakingly researched formulas that each do exactly one thing and do it well. Every student of blood magic can cast them, but each ritual must be studied on its own, whether from a teacher, a stolen grimoire, or years of lonely research. Rituals run from Level 1 to 5, matching both the mastery of Thaumaturgy the caster needs and the weight of the effect. Unless an entry says otherwise, casting takes five minutes per level.</p><p><b>System:</b> Roll Intelligence + Occult, difficulty 3 + the ritual's level (maximum 9). A single success is enough unless the ritual states otherwise. The Storyteller may dress a failure up as strange side effects, or let it wear the face of success until the worst possible moment; a botch can be catastrophic. Many rituals also demand material components, from herbs and bones to far stranger reagents, and hunting down the ingredients for a great working can carry an entire story. The first dot of Thaumaturgy grants one free Level One ritual; learning more takes a few nights for the simplest and years for the deepest.</p>`,
